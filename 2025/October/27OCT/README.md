*Below is my explanation for solving this daily challenge and below that is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp! Check the accompanying "solution.py" file for the actual solution code. I built the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".*

***This one took all of 20 to 30 seconds at the most. Still fun, and good for practice. Just created a string and iterated through the number passed into the function, manipulated the number by adding 1, changed data type to str/string, and concactenated it into the answer. One answer is built out, returned answer. Boom!***

## Integer Sequence
Given a positive integer, return a string with all of the integers from 1 up to, and including, the given number, in numerical order.

For example, given 5, return "12345".

****

    1. sequence(5) should return "12345".
    2. sequence(10) should return "12345678910".
    3. sequence(1) should return "1".
    4. sequence(27) should return "123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627".
