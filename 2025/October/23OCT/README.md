*Below is my explanation for solving this daily challenge and below that is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp! Check the accompanying "solution.py" file for the actual solution code. I built the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".*

***This one just involved some basic dictionary manipulation. Getting the number of plays per song and putting them in a list, using list and sort to select the songs from the playlist based on the highest number of plays, and finally putting together the list that would be answer that contains the highest played songs. Easy!***

## Favorite Songs

Remember iPods? The first model came out 24 years ago today, on Oct. 23, 2001.

Given an array of song objects representing your iPod playlist, return an array with the titles of the two most played songs, with the most played song first.

Each object will have a "title" property (string), and a "plays" property (integer).

    1. favorite_songs([{"title": "Sync or Swim", "plays": 3}, {"title": "Byte Me", "plays": 1}, {"title": "Earbud Blues", "plays": 2} ]) should return ["Sync or Swim", "Earbud Blues"].
    2. favorite_songs([{"title": "Skip Track", "plays": 98}, {"title": "99 Downloads", "plays": 99}, {"title": "Clickwheel Love", "plays": 100} ]) should return ["Clickwheel Love", "99 Downloads"].
    3. favorite_songs([{"title": "Song A", "plays": 42}, {"title": "Song B", "plays": 99}, {"title": "Song C", "plays": 75} ]) should return ["Song B", "Song C"].
