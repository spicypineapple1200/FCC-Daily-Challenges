*Below is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp. After that there is a divider and below that divider is the test cases for the accompanying python file for this challenge. *note, the python file can a return line and a print line at the end. The return line is the only one included in the original answer, the print line was used while building the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".

## Decimal to Binary
Given a non-negative integer, return its binary representation as a string.

A binary number uses only the digits 0 and 1 to represent any number. To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. Repeat until the number is zero. Read the remainders last recorded to first. For example, to convert 12 to binary:

12 รท 2 = 6 remainder 0
6 รท 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 รท 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 รท 2 = 0 remainder 1
12 in binary is 1100.

****

#### 1. to_binary(5) should return "101".
#### 2. to_binary(12) should return "1100".
#### 3. to_binary(50) should return "110010".
#### 4. to_binary(99) should return "1100011".
