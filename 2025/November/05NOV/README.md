*Below is my explanation for solving this daily challenge and below that is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp! Check the accompanying "solution.py" file for the actual solution code. I built the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".*

***This one was easy. A combination of embedded list coprehension and use of pythons range function solved this one.***

## [Matrix Builder](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2025-11-05)
Given two integers (a number of rows and a number of columns), return a matrix (an array of arrays) filled with zeros (0) of the given size.

For example, given 2 and 3, return:

    [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]

****

    1. build_matrix(2, 3) should return [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].
    2. build_matrix(3, 2) should return [[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]].
    3. build_matrix(4, 3) should return [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].
    4. build_matrix(9, 1) should return [[0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0]].
