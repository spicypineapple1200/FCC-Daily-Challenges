*Below is my explanation for solving this daily challenge and below that is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp! Check the accompanying "solution.py" file for the actual solution code. I built the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".*

***This one was simple. I used the code from yesterdays challenge, integrated into that a conditional statement to make sure the actual output of the Fizzbuzz challenge was compared to the sequence provided in this challenge. If they matched, we return True, and if not, we return False. Simple!***

## [BuzzFizz](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2025-11-26)
Given an array, determine if it is a correct FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to the last item in the array. A sequence is correct if:

Numbers that are multiples of 3 are replaced with "Fizz"
Numbers that are multiples of 5 are replaced with "Buzz"
Numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz"
All other numbers remain as integers in ascending order, starting from 1.
The array must start at 1 and have no missing or extra elements.

    1. is_fizz_buzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4]) should return True.
    2. is_fizz_buzz([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return False.
    3. is_fizz_buzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", 7]) should return False.
    4. is_fizz_buzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, "FizzBuzz"]) should return False.
    5. is_fizz_buzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, "Fizz"]) should return False.
    6. is_fizz_buzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, "Buzz"]) should return False.
    7. is_fizz_buzz([1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz", 16, 17, "Fizz", 19, "Buzz", "Fizz", 22, 23, "Fizz", "Buzz", 26, "Fizz", 28, 29, "FizzBuzz", 31, 32, "Fizz", 34, "Buzz", "Fizz", 37, 38, "Fizz", "Buzz", 41, "Fizz", 43, 44, "FizzBuzz", 46, 47, "Fizz", 49, "Buzz"]) should return True.
