*Below is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp. After that there is a divider and below that divider is the test cases for the accompanying python file for this challenge. *note, the python file can a return line and a print line at the end. The return line is the only one included in the original answer, the print line was used while building the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".

## Perfect Square
Given an integer, determine if it is a perfect square.

A number is a perfect square if you can multiply an integer by itself to achieve the number. For example, 9 is a perfect square because you can multiply 3 by itself to get it.

****

#### 1. is_perfect_square(9) should return True.
#### 2. is_perfect_square(49) should return True.
#### 3. is_perfect_square(1) should return True.
#### 4. is_perfect_square(2) should return False.
#### 5. is_perfect_square(99) should return False.
#### 6. is_perfect_square(-9) should return False.
#### 7. is_perfect_square(0) should return True.
#### 8. is_perfect_square(25281) should return True.
