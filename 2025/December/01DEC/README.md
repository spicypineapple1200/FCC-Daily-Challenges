*Below is my explanation for solving this daily challenge and below that is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp! Check the accompanying "solution.py" file for the actual solution code. I built the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".*

***This one was simple. I looked up the math for converting miles to kilometers, and used it along with pythons round function to get the answer. Easy!***

## [Miles to Kilometers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2025-12-01)
Given a distance in miles as a number, return the equivalent distance in kilometers.

The input will always be a non-negative number.
1 mile equals 1.60934 kilometers.
Round the result to two decimal places.

****

    1. convert_to_km(1) should return 1.61.
    2. convert_to_km(21) should return 33.8.
    3. convert_to_km(3.5) should return 5.63.
    4. convert_to_km(0) should return 0.
    5. convert_to_km(0.621371) should return 1.
