*Below is my explanation for solving this daily challenge and below that is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp! Check the accompanying "solution.py" file for the actual solution code. I built the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".*

****

***Simple answer here. I just used indexing to place everything from the old list in a new list. The start and stop places are left blank, the third has a -1 which tells python to start at the end of the list and continue working backwards until complete. Return the new list and done!***

## [Array Swap](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2026-01-15)

Given an array with two values, return an array with the values swapped.

For example, given ["A", "B"] return ["B", "A"].

****
    1. array_swap(["A", "B"]) should return ["B", "A"].
    2. array_swap([25, 20]) should return [20, 25].
    3. array_swap([True, False]) should return [False, True].
    4. array_swap(["1", 1]) should return [1, "1"].
