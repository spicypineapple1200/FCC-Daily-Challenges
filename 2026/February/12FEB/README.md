*Below is my explanation for solving this daily challenge and below that is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp! Check the accompanying "solution.py" file for the actual solution code. I built the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".*

***For this one I just kept a running variable that was updated when the absolute value of the difference between skater scores was exceeded. If it was, then the max difference and the lap it occurred in is recorded and at the end of the solution, that lap is returned!***

## [2026 Winter Games Day 7: Speed Skating](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2026-02-12)

Given two arrays representing the lap times (in seconds) for two speed skaters, return the lap number where the difference in lap times is the largest.

The first element of each array corresponds to lap 1, the second to lap 2, and so on.

    1. largest_difference([26.11, 25.80, 25.92, 26.23, 26.07], [25.93, 25.74, 26.53, 26.11, 26.30]) should return 3.
    2. largest_difference([27.04, 25.94, 26.22, 26.07, 26.18], [25.59, 25.80, 26.11, 26.01, 26.23]) should return 1.
    3. largest_difference([25.82, 25.90, 26.05, 26.00, 26.48], [25.85, 25.92, 26.07, 25.98, 25.95]) should return 5.
    4. largest_difference([25.88, 26.10, 25.95, 26.05, 26.00], [25.90, 26.55, 25.92, 26.03, 26.01]) should return 2.
    5. largest_difference([25.92, 26.01, 26.05, 25.88, 26.12], [25.95, 26.00, 26.03, 26.45, 26.10]) should return 4.
