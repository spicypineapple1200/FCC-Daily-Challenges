*Below is my explanation for solving this daily challenge and below that is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp! Check the accompanying "solution.py" file for the actual solution code. I built the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".*

***For this one I created a dictionary and organized the teams based on their scores, adding logic to tally the scores according to the problems direction. After that I put the teams in order based on score, pulled the first four, and created an f string with the summation of what teams face who in the semi finals.***

## [2026 Winter Games Day 11: Ice Hockey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2026-02-16)

Given an array of 6 ice hockey teams and their records after the round robin games, determine the match-ups for the semi-final round.

Each array item will have a team and their record in the format "TEAM: W-OTW-OTL-L". Where:
"W" is the number of wins in regulation, worth 3 points each
"OTW" is the number of overtime wins, worth 2 points each
"OTL" is the number of overtime losses, worth 1 point each
"L" is the number of losses, worth 0 points each
For example, "FIN: 2-2-1-0" would have 11 points after adding up their record.

Find the total number of points for each team and return "The semi-final games will be (1st) vs (4th) and (2nd) vs (3rd).". For example, "The semi-final games will be FIN vs SWE and CAN vs USA."

    1. get_semifinal_matchups(["CAN: 2-2-0-1", "FIN: 2-2-1-0", "GER: 1-0-1-3", "SUI: 0-1-3-1", "SWE: 1-1-2-1", "USA: 2-1-0-2"]) should return "The semi-final games will be FIN vs SWE and CAN vs USA.".
    2. get_semifinal_matchups(["CAN: 2-1-1-1", "CZE: 1-1-1-2", "FIN: 1-2-1-1", "NOR: 0-1-1-3", "SLO: 1-0-1-3", "USA: 5-0-0-0"]) should return "The semi-final games will be USA vs CZE and CAN vs FIN.".
    3. get_semifinal_matchups(["CAN: 3-2-0-0", "CZE: 2-1-2-0", "LAT: 0-0-1-4", "ITA: 1-1-1-2", "DEN: 1-0-0-4", "USA: 3-1-1-0"]) should return "The semi-final games will be CAN vs ITA and USA vs CZE.".
    4. get_semifinal_matchups(["AUT: 2-2-1-0", "DEN: 1-0-0-4", "ITA: 1-1-1-2", "JPN: 3-2-0-0", "KOR: 2-1-2-0", "LAT: 0-0-1-4"]) should return "The semi-final games will be JPN vs ITA and AUT vs KOR.".
