*Below is my explanation for solving this daily challenge and below that is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp! Check the accompanying "solution.py" file for the actual solution code. I built the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".*

***Played around with datetime a lot for this one. Ultimately wrote logic to subtract the original time from the others to get the difference and build another list while iterating.***

## [2026 Winter Games Day 5: Cross-Country Skiing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2026-02-10)

Given an array of finish times for a cross-country ski race, convert them into times behind the winner.

Given times are strings in "H:MM:SS" format.
Given times will be in order from fastest to slowest.
The winners time (fastest time) should correspond to "0".
Each other time should show the time behind the winner, in the format "+M:SS".
For example, given ["1:25:32", "1:26:10", "1:27:05"], return ["0", "+0:38", "+1:33"].

****
    1. get_relative_results(["1:25:32", "1:26:10", "1:27:05"]) should return ["0", "+0:38", "+1:33"].
    2. get_relative_results(["1:00:01", "1:00:05", "1:00:10"]) should return ["0", "+0:04", "+0:09"].
    3. get_relative_results(["1:10:06", "1:10:23", "1:10:48", "1:12:11"]) should return ["0", "+0:17", "+0:42", "+2:05"].
    4. get_relative_results(["0:49:13", "0:49:15", "0:50:14", "0:51:30", "0:51:58", "0:52:16", "0:53:12", "0:53:31", "0:56:19", "1:02:20"]) should return ["0", "+0:02", "+1:01", "+2:17", "+2:45", "+3:03", "+3:59", "+4:18", "+7:06", "+13:07"].
    5. get_relative_results(["2:01:15", "2:10:45", "2:10:53", "2:11:04", "2:11:55", "2:13:27", "2:14:30", "2:15:10"]) should return ["0", "+9:30", "+9:38", "+9:49", "+10:40", "+12:12", "+13:15", "+13:55"].
