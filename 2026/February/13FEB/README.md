*Below is my explanation for solving this daily challenge and below that is the original challenge in freeCodeCamp! Check the accompanying "solution.py" file for the actual solution code. I built the solution in the online IDE found at "https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/".*

***For this one I calculated the speed for each time, and kept a running variable, x, to track the fastest one. Another variable, y, kept track of the segment. This ran in a loop and after checking each time, returned the one with the highest speed in an f string.***

## [2026 Winter Games Day 8: Luge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2026-02-13)

Given an array of five numbers, each representing the time (in seconds) it took a luger to complete a segment of a track, determine which segment had the fastest speed and what that speed was.

The track is divided into the following segments:

Segment 1: 320 meters
Segment 2: 280 meters
Segment 3: 350 meters
Segment 4: 300 meters
Segment 5: 250 meters
The first value in the given array corresponds to the time for segment 1, the second value to segment 2, and so on.

To calculate the speed (in meters per second) for a segment, divide the distance by the time.

Return "The luger's fastest speed was X m/s on segment Y.". Where X is the fastest speed, rounded to two decimal places, and Y is the segment number where the fastest speed occurred.

    1. get_fastest_speed([9.523, 8.234, 10.012, 9.001, 7.128]) should return "The luger's fastest speed was 35.07 m/s on segment 5."
    2. get_fastest_speed([9.381, 7.417, 9.912, 8.815, 7.284]) should return "The luger's fastest speed was 37.75 m/s on segment 2."
    3. get_fastest_speed([8.890, 7.601, 9.093, 8.392, 6.912]) should return "The luger's fastest speed was 38.49 m/s on segment 3."
    4. get_fastest_speed([8.490, 7.732, 10.103, 8.489, 6.840]) should return "The luger's fastest speed was 37.69 m/s on segment 1."
    5. get_fastest_speed([8.204, 7.230, 9.673, 7.645, 6.508]) should return "The luger's fastest speed was 39.24 m/s on segment 4."
